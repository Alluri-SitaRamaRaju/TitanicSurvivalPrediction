# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
A machine learning project to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a Random Forest Classifier:


Data Cleaning: Handles missing values for age and embarked status using imputation.

Data Preprocessing: Uses a scikit-learn Pipeline for a streamlined and reproducible workflow.

Model Training: Implements a RandomForestClassifier to predict survival.

Data Visualization: Includes a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between features.
